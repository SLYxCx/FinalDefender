Welcome to a planetary experience!
In this project hub, you will discover the beginnings of a venture to pixelated gaming through the jungles of .NET maui and the desserted plains of WPF. 
Follow us as we uncover the unknown terraces of console errors and stagnated frames and the sparks of hope and imbue us to innovate.

The first project is a Space Invaders type game designed to pit the user against a folly of enemy onslaught in a timed race of wits.
Components of razor files, class inheritance, and maui user interfaces, bring to life a wandering wonderer's dream.
These effectively challenege the limitations of the .NET maui framework and push the boundaries of what is possible.

The second is a journey through intergalactic galaxies as you navigate into a realm of heinous spacecraft and guided missiles dedicated to stopping your exploration. 
Can you survive the relentless attack?
This solar system of discovery was brought to life with the effective use of wpf .NET framework that allowed our familiarity with C# syntax to incorporate many desired features into a finished product.
Understanding of recursion, nested functions, class structure, inheritance, and software compatability proved invaluable to designing the ideal game presentation.
We sincerely hope you enjoy this astronomical coding experience!
